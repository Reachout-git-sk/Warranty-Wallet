# 🛡️ WarrantyWallet

### Never Lose a Receipt. Never Miss a Warranty.

WarrantyWallet is a full-stack web application that helps people organize their expensive electronics and appliances. One part acts as a **Digital Receipt Box** to prove ownership, and the other acts as a **Warranty Vault** to store warranty terms, PDF manuals, and support contacts.
